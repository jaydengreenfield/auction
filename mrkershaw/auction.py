# Task 2 â€“ Buyer bids.

A buyer should be able to find an item and view the item number, description and the current highest
bid. A buyer can then enter their buyer number and bid, which must be higher than any previously
recorded bids. Every time a new bid is recorded the number of bids for that item is increased by one.
Buyers can bid for an item many times and they can bid for many items.
