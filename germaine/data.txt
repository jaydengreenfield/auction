-10 items (pre-prepared) with:
   -item number (id)
   -number of bids
   -description
   -reserve fee

-Set bid_num to 0 (number of bids)

-Also store variable named buyer_number (done when asked for id number)
   -Store buyer's bid into a variable named highest_bid
   -Store buyer number + bid into a list / dictionary (?)

-At the end:
   -total fee
-For items that have not reached reserve price:
   -item numbers
   -final bids
-For items that have no bids:
   -item numbers
-For items sold:
   -display sold_num (variable containing number of items sold)
-Then:
   -show items that have not reached reserve price
-Finally display:
   -how many sold
   -how many didn't reach reserve price
